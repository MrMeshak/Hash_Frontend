Hash is a developer feedback website enabling the community to suggest new features,
identify bugs and propose changes to the UI/UX. Users can up-vote posts, comment on
posts and reply to comments (similar to Reddit). The developers then place certain
requests into the road map to help keep users informed on which suggestions are
currently being planned, worked on or are currently live on the site.

## Features

- Server Side Rendering for public pages to enable better SEO and time to first byte
- Static Site Generation for static pages (login,signup,etc)
- Fully responsive design that adapts to any display size
- User accounts, authentication, dynamic pages based on user and secured
  backend API
- Full form validation and user prompts.
- Create, Update, Delete functionality for user posts
- Support for Comments and nested replies to comments
- Sorting & filtering of posts (implemented on backend for scalability and to support
  pagination)
